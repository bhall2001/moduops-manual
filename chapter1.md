ModuOps makes assumptions based on it's roots for how an Operation Session runs. ModuOps takes into account the nuances of Operations Plans for Modular layouts. The original Users of ModuOps are Free-mo modulers.

A Free-mo layout has many unique characteristics not found with other Model Railroad setups. A Free-mo layout is unique at each setup. Free-mo layouts by Standards Definition are to focus on Operations. The participants have varying degrees of Expertise in Railroad Operations. The rollingstock is not known until placed on the layout. The layout exists for a short period of time and will never exist in the same configuration every again.

ModuOps 1.0 series enherits most of it's use cases from the original Mad River and Big Timber (MRBT) software. With this in mind, this Chapter helps new users get up to speed faster. Most of the Applciation features directly stem from the prior experience with MRBT and with New England Free-mo.

ModuOps is a random car type generator. The software essentially takes a list of car types and randomly assigning them to locations on the layout.
