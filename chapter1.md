# Best Practice

ModuOps makes assumptions based on it's roots for how an Operation Session runs. ModuOps takes into account the nuances of Operations Plans for Modular layouts. The original Users of ModuOps are Free-mo modulers.

A Free-mo layout has many unique characteristics not found with other Model Railroad setups. A Free-mo layout is unique at each setup. Free-mo layouts by Standards Definition are to focus on Operations. The participants have varying degrees of Expertise in Railroad Operations. The rollingstock is not known until placed on the layout. The layout exists for a short period of time and will never exist in the same configuration every again.

ModuOps 1.0 series enherits most of it's use cases from the original Mad River and Big Timber (MRBT) software. With this in mind, this Chapter helps new users get up to speed faster. Most of the Applciation features directly stem from the prior experience with MRBT and with New England Free-mo.

ModuOps is a random car type generator. The software essentially takes a list of car types and randomly assigning them to locations on the layout. Car reporting marks are not needed for Operations with the software.

The lack of car reporting marks is the reason ModuOps works so well on a Free-mo layout. The administrative overhead to maintain the specfic car reporting marks takes an inordanent amount of time. In fact, the time invested in this task alone typically exceeds the life-span of the layout by many factors.

ModuOps works best when there is a sourcing yard that sends car types to Consignees. Large layouts can be split into Districts with different yards acting as the source of cars for areas of the Layout.

ModuOps is Stateless. That means that the system does not store any information about the past, present or future state of the layout. Another advantage in a layout where "Free-running" occurs between formal operations sessions. ModuOps does not need the layout to be setup in any particular manner prior to the operationing session starting.

ModuOps does not have the ability to schedule a "Pick Up". This is the direct result of the software being Stateless.

ModuOps is a modular system allowing for scheduling engine Plugins. The initial release of the software ships with the Free Mad River and Big Timber scheduling engine. The MRBT scheduling engine
