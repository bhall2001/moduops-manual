# ModuOps Manual

Welcome to the manual for the ModuOps software system.

This book pertains to version 1.0.0 of the ModuOps software. ModuOps came into being from a desire by the New England Free-mo group to create a modern car routing system. The primary goal of the group is to reduce the amount of administration needed to get a Modular layout up and Operating.

ModuOps finds it's roots in a package called "Mad River and Big Timber" (MRBT for short). MRBT came from a Modular group in California in the 90s. Their goal was also to get a Modular layout up and running with minimal administrative overhead.

MRBT was a product of the late 90s and appears to have seen it's last update in the year 2000. The New Englan Free-mo group was able to keep old laptops around up until about 2015 to run the software. However, there are just too many challenges in doing that.

ModuOps 1.0.0 essentially replicates the MRBT software package with some changes. The system is based on a modern graphical user interface (GUI). Routing logic is more sophistacate than the original MRBT. The hooks are in place to take ModuOps Online and integrate today's modern SmartPhone and Tablet technologies.

For those who care, ModuOps is written in Livecode. Livecode is a modern, rapid development tool incorporating a number advanced capabilities. ModuOps version 1.0.0 uses a SQL database and is available on Windows and Macintosh systems.
